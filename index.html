  <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
  <p class="indent">Antimatter is the counterpart to matter and should have been created in equal amounts at the Big Bang. Yet almost no antimatter exists in the universe today, leaving behind one of physics’ biggest unanswered questions: why did matter survive while antimatter disappeared? This article explores this imbalance, examining what might have happened to antimatter and what this mystery reveals about the early universe. We discuss current theories and experiments, including studies of symmetry violations, antimatter production, and the challenges of storing it. Research so far has revealed small differences between matter and antimatter, but not enough to explain why our universe is made of matter. Understanding this problem could reshape ideas about how the universe formed and may point towards new discoveries in physics and technology. Solving the antimatter puzzle may ultimately help explain why anything, including life, exists at all.</p>

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="indent">Antimatter is the opposite of the matter that makes up everything around us, with each particle, such as the electron, having an antiparticle counterpart of equal mass but opposite charge and properties. When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate one another and release energy. Although first predicted in the early 20th century and later confirmed through particle physics experiments and cosmic observations, antimatter remains almost entirely absent from everyday life. This absence is puzzling because the Big Bang should have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, meaning that both should have annihilated and left behind only energy. Instead, our universe exists, implying a fundamental imbalance in nature that is not yet understood. This paper explores what antimatter is, why it is expected to exist in equal quantity to matter, and why it appears to be missing today. To do so, it examines current scientific theories and experimental findings on matter–antimatter behaviour, including symmetry violations, creation methods, and containment challenges, in order to understand the efforts being made to solve this major question in physics and what it can reveal about the origins of the universe.</p>

  <h3 id="Unequal-Amount">Why Is There an Unequal Amount?</h3>
  <p class="indent">If matter and antimatter were created equally, they should have annihilated each other completely. Instead, a tiny imbalance, roughly one extra matter particle per billion, allowed all matter to survive. This problem is known as the matter–antimatter asymmetry. Scientists have observed subtle differences between matter and antimatter. For example, a recent experiment at CERN showed that a matter particle and its antimatter twin decayed at different rates by about 2.5%, with a significance of 5.2 sigma (roughly a 1-in-10-million chance that the result is random). This is an important clue, but still not enough to explain the scale of the imbalance. In simple terms, the universe seems biased towards matter, and we don’t yet know why.</p>

  <h3 id="What-And-What">What Does It Tell Us and What Can We Do with It?</h3>
  <p class="indent">Understanding antimatter helps scientists test the foundations of physics: gravity, quantum forces, and even time symmetry. If antimatter behaves differently from matter in subtle ways, those differences could require parts of physics to be rewritten. On a practical level, antimatter has real uses. Medical facilities use positrons in PET scans to observe detailed activity inside the human body. Researchers are also studying antimatter for potential propulsion systems - <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666202724004518">see Figure 1</a> for a reference of how the propulsion technology could be created. The energy released when matter and antimatter meet is enormous, far greater than that produced in nuclear fusion or chemical reactions. The U.S. Department of Energy notes that antimatter annihilation releases “vast amounts of energy,” making it a potential tool for future spacecraft. In theory, only a small amount of antimatter could power missions beyond our solar system. Of course, this is still more science fiction than reality, but it's based in real physics. Antimatter research may one day help us develop new energy systems, understand dark matter, or uncover undiscovered forces of nature.</p>

  <h3 id="How-And-Why">How Can We Synthesise or Create It and Why Is It So Hard To?</h3>
  <p class="indent">Even though antimatter is rare in the universe, scientists can create it — albeit in extremely tiny amounts. Particle accelerators, like the ones at CERN, are used to collide particles together at high speed, and these collisions can briefly form antiparticles. But producing antimatter is incredibly energy-intensive and inefficient - <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/86283">see Figure 2</a> for a reference of the energy required for a proton–antiproton annihilation. As explained in a physics study, producing even small quantities requires vast amounts of energy and specialised magnetic containment tools to prevent annihilation. The difficulty doesn’t stop after creation. Antimatter cannot touch regular matter, including the walls of a container, or it will instantly annihilate. This means scientists must trap antimatter using magnetic fields, and even then, they have only managed to hold small numbers of antiparticles for short periods of time (see Figure 3).</p>

  <p class="indent">To give an idea of rarity, the total antimatter created by humans so far is only enough to power a lightbulb for a few minutes. Producing one gram would cost trillions of dollars at current technological levels. This challenge is why antimatter is still a research subject rather than a usable fuel source today.</p>

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p class="indent">By examining current theories, experiments, and challenges in antimatter research, this paper aimed to understand what may have happened to antimatter after the Big Bang and what this mystery tells us about the origins of the universe. Evidence reviewed shows that scientists have detected small differences between matter and antimatter, but these findings do not yet fully explain the imbalance that allowed matter, and life, to exist. Continued research into symmetry violations, antimatter production, and containment remains essential, as each new result brings us closer to understanding this abnormal asymmetry. Beyond addressing this question, studying this topic highlights how much remains unknown about the early universe and the laws that govern it. The antimatter puzzle encourages us to rethink assumptions about symmetry, forces, and the nature of existence. While practical applications are still limited, the process of investigating antimatter advances scientific knowledge and deepens our appreciation of how extraordinary it is that a universe made of matter formed at all. Through this research, we not only explore a major scientific problem, but also gain insight into why anything, including ourselves, is here to begin with.</p>
