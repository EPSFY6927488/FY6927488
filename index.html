      Antimatter is the opposite of matter and should have been created in equal amounts at the Big Bang. Yet almost no antimatter exists in the universe today, leaving behind one of physics’ biggest unanswered questions: why did matter survive while antimatter disappeared? 
      This article explores this imbalance, looking at what might have happened to antimatter and what this mystery reveals about the early universe. We discuss current theories and experiments, including studies on symmetry violations, antimatter production, and the challenges of storing it. Research so far has found small differences between matter and antimatter, but not enough to explain why our universe is made of matter. 
      Understanding this problem could reshape ideas about how the universe formed and point toward new discoveries in physics and technology. Solving the antimatter puzzle may ultimately help explain why anything, including life, exists at all.

    <p class="ex1">
     Antimatter is the opposite of the matter that makes up everything around us, with each particle such as the electron having an antiparticle counterpart of equal mass but opposite charge and properties. When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate one another and release energy. Although first predicted in the early 20th century and later confirmed through particle physics experiments and cosmic observations, antimatter remains almost entirely absent in everyday life. This absence is puzzling because the Big Bang should have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, meaning both should have annihilated and left behind only energy. Instead, our universe exists, implying a fundamental imbalance in nature that is not yet understood. This paper explores what antimatter is, why it is expected to exist in equal quantity to matter, and why it appears missing today. To do so, it examines current scientific theories and experimental findings on matter–antimatter behaviour, including symmetry violations, creation methods, and containment challenges, in order to understand the efforts being made to solve this major question in physics and what it can reveal about the origins of the universe.
